UPDATES:
v2: 
-The code is slightly faster overall, and multiple CPUs can now be used for some parts.
v3:
-A general improvement in readability: comments have been added, the file structure is simpler, unused variables have been removed etc..
-Examples of input + expected output are now included for verification. 
-Instead of precompiled mex-files, the script "mexAll.m" is now provided to allow users to compile their own.
-The program now makes sure that should-be numerical inputs are converted to such, should they have been passed as strings. This ought to help a stand-alone executable for plmDCA to work properly.

---------------------------------------------
This is a MATLAB-implementation of the symmetric version of plmDCA.
The program uses 'minFunc' by Mark Schmidt (contained in the folder '3rd_party_code'), which can be found at http://www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/Software/minFunc.html.


HOW TO USE:
	1) In MATLAB, go to the directory containing mexAll.m, and give the command 
	>mexAll 
	to create mex files appropriate for your system.
	2) Call the program as
	plmDCA_symmetric(fastafile,outputfile,lambda_h,lambda_J,reweighting_threshold,nr_of_cores)
	
 
INPUTS TO PLMDCA: 
	fastafile:
	Alignment file in FASTA format. Inserts, which should be represented by '.' and lower-case letters (as is standard in the Pfam download), are removed automatically by the program.

	outputfile:
	This becomes a file with N(N-1)/2 rows (N=domain length), each with three entries: residue i, residue j, and interaction score for the pair (i,j).

	lambda_h:
	Field-regularization strength (typical value: 0.01).

	lambda_J:
	Coupling-regularization strength (typical value: 0.01).

	%%%%%%%%%
	A note on the regularization strengths above: 
	lambda_h=lambda_J=0.01 works well across a wide range of families, and this value is reasonably robust towards changes (at least upwards). It has been reported that when the number of homologous sequences (B) is very small (a few hundred), raising this up toward 0.1 can improve performance.
	%%%%%%%%%

	reweighting_threshold:
	Required fraction of nonidentical amino acids for two sequences to be counted as independent (typical values: 0.1-0.3).
	Note that this is not the threshold 'x' as defined in the papers, but 1-x.
 	
	nr_of_cores:
	The number of cores to use on the local machine. 
	If this argument is >1, the program calls functions from MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox.


TYPICAL CALL (ON A QUAD-CORE MACHINE):
	plmDCA_symmetric('PF00014_full.txt','PF00014_scores.txt',0.01,0.01,0.1,4)
