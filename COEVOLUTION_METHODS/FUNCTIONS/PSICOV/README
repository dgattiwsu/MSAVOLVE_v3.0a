USAGE NOTES FOR PSICOV V1.05

(See LICENSE file for details on licensing terms)


Compiling
=========

gfortran -O3 psicov.c glasso_psicov.f90 -lm -lgsl -lgslcblas -o psicov

Requirements:

1. GNU Scientific Library (gsl)
2. glasso_psicov.f90 (glasso.f90 from CRAN package patched according to glasso.diffs)

The glasso code should be obtainable from here:
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glasso/index.html


Typical usage
=============

Set target precision matrix sparsity:

psicov -d 0.03 demo.aln > output


Outputting raw scores rather than estimated PPVs:

psicov -k demo.aln > output


Output contacts separated by 12 or more in the sequence:

psicov -j 12 demo.aln > output


Ignore alignment columns with > 30% gaps:

psicov -g 0.3 demo.aln > output


Recommended options for quicker results (quick enough for very large proteins):

psicov -a -r 0.001 -i 62 demo.aln > output


********************************************************************************************************

Recommended options for slower but more accurate results (probably too slow for very large proteins):

psicov -p -d 0.03 demo.aln > output

These options select the glasso exact algorithm, target contact density of 3% and by default, corrects the
the BLOSUM weighting cutoff for highly conserved or very divergent families. It also attempts to estimate
PPV (precision) for each predicted contact rather than outputting arbitrary raw scores.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============

Please note that a large number of _diverse_ homologous sequences are needed for contact prediction to succeed. In
the original paper, the worst example had 511 homologous sequences and the best had 74836. If you try to calculate
contacts with very few sequences, then at best the results will be poor, or at worst psicov will not be able to
converge on a solution and keep running forever! In the latter case, convergence can be achieved by increasing the
rho parameter to 0.005 or 0.01 say (default is 0.001) e.g. psicov -r 0.005 -i 62 demo.aln > output

However, even if PSICOV does converge this will not necessarily produce good contact predictions - you cannot
avoid the issue of needing a lot of sequence data to properly compute the pairwise correlations.

PSICOV will give an error if an alignment with too few sequences is used, and will also print a warning if there is
insufficient sequence variation. You can override these checks by modifying the code, but bear in mind that
PSICOV can only work on VERY LARGE sequence families. If you only have a handful of sequences, or if the sequences
are all very similar, then you simply do not have enough data to analyse. For best results you need a sequence
alignment with >1000 sequences and a large amount of sequence variation between the sequences.
